    <h1>What is Badminton?</h1>


    <p>Badminton is a sport in which two players or teams of two players use a stringed racket to hit a special ball
     consisting
     <p> of a cork tip and 16 feathers over the net to the opponent's side.</p>
    <p>It's also a sport that improves physical and cognitive skills and helps individuals to become more flexible. </p>
   <p> It helps to improve your mood and concentration. Badminton is a game that anyone can play, regardless
     of their skill level, it's also a sport</p>
    <p>that explores speed changes, reaction time demands, muscular strength and endurance challenges, and </p>
    <p> is heart-pumping fun. This newly identified Olympic Sport offers benefits to all who pick up a racket and a shuttle for </p>
    <p> a test outing on the court.</p>
