        Badminton could be traced back to more than 2000 years ago to the ancient game called battledore (bat or paddle) and <br>
        shuttlecock (also called “bird” or “birdie”), 
        <br>similar games 
        were played for centuries across Eurasia countries such as Greece, Egypt, China, India, and Japan. <br>
        From the 1600s, battledore and shuttlecock was just a game involving 2 persons hitting a
        shuttlecock towards each other <br>

        as many times as possible before it hit the<br> ground and it used to be an upper-class game in Europe, including England. 
        Nowadays, You can still find a similar game in Japan which is called Hanetsuki, it’s<br> a very popular new year’s game 
        involving a wooden paddle called hagoita<br> and a shuttle called hane.<br>
