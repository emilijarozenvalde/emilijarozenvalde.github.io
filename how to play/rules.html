    <h1>Badminton</h1>
    <h2>Individual Sport</h2>
    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <p>A player must wait until his opponent is ready before serving. If the opponent attempts a return then he is ruled having been ready.<p>
    <p>The feet of both players must remain in a stationary position until the serve is made. Your feet can not be touching the line at this time.</p>
    <p>It is not a fault if you miss the shuttle while serving.</p>
    <p>The shuttle cannot be caught and slung with the racket.</p>
    <p>A player cannot hold his racket near the net to ward off a downward stroke by his opponent or to interfere with his racket.</p>
